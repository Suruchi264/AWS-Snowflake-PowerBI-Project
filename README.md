# AWS-Snowflake-PowerBI-Project

# Agriculture Analysis on Various Parameters

In this project, we began by setting up an Amazon S3 bucket and loading the initial dataset into it. A specific role was then created to securely handle data access, followed by the creation of an integration object in Snowflake and the necessary updates to its trust policy to ensure smooth communication between services. Once the setup was complete, data from the S3 bucket was successfully loaded into Snowflake. With the data available, an in-depth understanding phase was conducted to explore the dataset, after which data transformation processes were carried out using Snowflake SQL, including the addition of a new column to categorize data based on rainfall groups. Following this, the transformed data was imported into Power BI from Snowflake, where the dashboard development phase began. A detailed Rainfall Analysis page was added to the report to offer insights based on the new categorization. Additional pages were incorporated to cover other relevant aspects of the data, enhancing the overall analytical value of the report. Finally, the entire Power BI report was published to the Power BI Service, making it accessible for broader consumption and sharing within the organization.
